"""Patch-integrity release gate for Clearcote.

Clearcote *is* its patch set — every stealth behavior lives in `patches/`, applied on top
of a pinned Chromium. A patch that silently fails to apply, gets dropped on an incremental
rebuild, or is left out of a stale committed set does NOT crash the browser: it still
launches and runs, just **less stealthy**. That failure is invisible to any "does it start?"
smoke test, so it must be caught by an explicit, release-blocking gate. This is that gate.

WHY THREE LAYERS — "applied" means three different things, and each fails independently:

  Layer 1  APPLIED TO SOURCE   The whole series reverse-applies cleanly, as a stack in REVERSE
                               order, to a throwaway hardlink copy of the build tree. A later
                               patch routinely edits a file an earlier one created (002 creates
                               persona_profile.cc, 170 later extends it), so an *independent*
                               per-patch reverse dry-run is a false positive — only peeling the
                               stack in reverse series order restores the pristine state each
                               earlier patch expects. Catches a silently-rejected/dropped patch
                               at build time, and a stale committed `patches/` that no longer
                               reproduces the built tree. Zero-maintenance: the patch files are
                               the spec, so a newly added patch is covered automatically.
  Layer 2  COMPILED INTO BINARY Each patch's required marker string(s) are present in the shipped
                               chrome / chrome.dll. Catches "source is right but the binary is
                               stale" — an incremental build that didn't recompile the touched
                               translation unit, the wrong out-dir, or dead-code elimination.
  Layer 3  EFFECTIVE AT RUNTIME A behavioral witness per surface actually observes the effect.
                               Catches "compiled in but broken." Delegated to
                               scripts/stealth_coherence.py + the per-patch witnesses recorded in
                               scripts/patch_markers.json (see docs/PATCH-INTEGRITY.md).

Any failure exits non-zero, so scripts/01-apply-patches.sh, the release runbook, and CI all
abort. See docs/PATCH-INTEGRITY.md for the standard and how to add a witness for a new patch.

Usage:
  # Layer 0 (series/manifest integrity) always runs.
  # Layer 1 — against the build tree (run at build time AND right before packaging):
  python scripts/verify_patches.py --tree ~/clearcote-build/build/src --target windows
  # Layer 2 — against a shipped binary, a directory of binaries, or the release zip:
  python scripts/verify_patches.py --binary out/Default/chrome.dll
  python scripts/verify_patches.py --binary clearcote-149.0.7827.114-windows-x64.zip
  # Both (the full pre-release gate):
  python scripts/verify_patches.py --tree <src> --target windows --binary <chrome.dll>

Stdlib only. Exit 0 = every checked layer clean; exit 1 = a patch is not correctly applied.

    order, onto a throwaway hardlink copy of the tree.

    Why reverse order (not independent per-patch dry-runs): the series is a *stack* — a later
    patch frequently modifies a file an earlier patch created (e.g. 002 creates
    persona_profile.cc, 170 later edits it). An independent `patch -R --dry-run` of 002 against
    the FINAL tree then fails, because 170's additions are still present: the file is no longer
    in the exact state 002 left it. That is a false positive — 002 IS correctly applied.
    Reversing the stack in reverse series order (210, 200, ... 000) validates the tree the same
    way it was built: each reverse step removes one patch's contribution, exposing the pristine
    state the NEXT-earlier patch expects. If every step reverses cleanly, the tree was produced
    by applying the series in order and no patch is missing or mangled.

    The reverse runs on a same-filesystem hardlink copy (cp -al: instant, only the files patch
    actually rewrites are duplicated), so the real build tree is never mutated — a later
